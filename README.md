# API-Project


My project, GitLaughBot, is a Node.js mashup that allows users to log in with their GitHub account via OAuth 2.0, fetch a random joke from the JokeAPI, and automatically post it as an issue to a specified GitHub repository. It demonstrates synchronous API interaction using only built-in Node.js modules.
